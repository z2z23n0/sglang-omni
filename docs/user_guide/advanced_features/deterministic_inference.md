# Deterministic inference

Deterministic inference means defining which parts of a model's output remain
stable when the same request is repeated. A fixed sampling seed alone does not
guarantee identical output across batch shapes, concurrency, devices, kernels,
or pipeline topology.

## Reproducibility levels

Document the strongest contract that has actually been validated:

| Level | Contract |
|---|---|
| Seeded sampling | The random token draws repeat under the same execution shape |
| Request-level reproducibility | A request repeats under a documented server configuration |
| Batch invariance | Output is unchanged when runtime batch composition changes |
| Byte identity | Encoded or PCM output bytes are identical under the stated conditions |

Always record the checkpoint revision, request, seed, software commit,
hardware, precision, launch configuration, concurrency, and output comparison.

## Current opt-in mode

Qwen3-TTS Base is the current pipeline with an explicit engine-wide
deterministic mode. Enable it in the pipeline configuration:

```yaml
config_cls: Qwen3TTSPipelineConfig
model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base
enable_deterministic_inference: true
```

Under the qualified contract, the same prompt, reference audio, reference
transcript, and seed produce byte-identical PCM across runtime batch sizes.
Both the 0.6B and 1.7B Base checkpoints support the mode.

## Performance tradeoff

Qwen3-TTS deterministic mode changes execution policy to remove known sources
of batch-dependent output:

- reference preprocessing is serialized;
- Talker compilation is disabled;
- vocoder decoding is serialized when needed for stable ordering;
- the initial vocoder CUDA Graph is disabled.

These changes reduce throughput, so the mode is opt-in. Do not enable it in a
recommended configuration without stating the performance cost.

## Other seeded models

Some models provide request-scoped seeds without an engine-wide deterministic
mode. Their cookbooks define the narrower contract. For example, MOSS-TTS Local
documents seeded request reproducibility, while default-mode Qwen3-TTS does not
claim batch-invariant PCM.

Do not generalize one model's result to a different checkpoint, precision,
GPU, kernel, or topology.

## Validate a claim

1. Pin every source-of-truth revision and the full launch configuration.
2. Repeat identical requests at concurrency 1 and under mixed batches.
3. Compare the artifact appropriate to the claim: tokens, decoded samples,
   PCM bytes, or encoded files.
4. Report every mismatch and failed request; do not average them away.
5. Measure throughput and latency separately so the reproducibility cost is
   visible.
