# Qwen3-ASR

[Qwen3-ASR](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B) is a multilingual
audio transcription model served through the OpenAI-compatible transcription
API.

## At a glance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Task | ASR |
| Checkpoint | `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B` |
| Endpoint | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Pipeline | audio preprocessing → ASR engine → response formatting |
| Input | One uploaded audio file per request |
| Output | Text, JSON, or verbose JSON transcript |
| Streaming | SSE transcript output; complete uploaded-file input, up to 1,200 seconds |
| Maturity | Supported |
| Qualified checkpoint | `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B` (recurring CI does not pin a model revision) |
| Qualified configuration | Two router workers using the model-derived default |
| Evidence hardware | 2× H100 (one per worker) |
| Validation | CI tested |
| Evidence | [ASR CI preset](../../tests/test_model/asr_ci_config.py), [router fixture](../../tests/test_model/test_asr_ci_seedtts.py), and [H100 workflow](../../.github/workflows/test-asr-ci.yaml) |

Qwen3-ASR does not support `/v1/audio/translations`; that route returns HTTP
400. See the [audio translation matrix](../basic_usage/audio_translations.md)
for models that support it.

## Install

Install SGLang-Omni by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md),
then resolve a fixed model revision for a reproducible local setup:

```bash
MODEL_REVISION=7278e1e70fe206f11671096ffdd38061171dd6e5
MODEL_PATH=$(hf download Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B --revision "${MODEL_REVISION}")
```

## Deploy

### Recommended configuration

Qwen3-ASR runs one ASR stage on one GPU:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path "${MODEL_PATH}" \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B \
  --port 8000
```

The command above pins a revision for a reproducible user setup. Recurring CI
currently uses the unpinned Hugging Face repository ID and places two workers
using the model-derived configuration behind the router, with one H100 assigned
to each worker. The command above is therefore not the complete CI topology.

### RTX 4090 profile

Use the checked-in profile on a 24 GB RTX 4090:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_asr_rtx4090.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

This checked-in profile keeps BF16, limits the stage to 16 running requests,
and sets `mem_fraction_static` to `0.65`. It is an available hardware-specific
profile, not a recurring-CI qualification or a minimum for other GPU
architectures.

## Send a request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F model=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B \
  -F file=@tests/data/query_to_cars.wav \
  -F response_format=json
```

See the [Transcription API](../user_guide/serving/transcription_api.md) for
shared request fields, response formats, usage, and errors.

## Model capabilities

### Language hints

When `language` is omitted, Qwen3-ASR detects the spoken language before
transcribing. Set an explicit hint when the language is known or automatic
detection is unreliable for short or ambiguous audio.

Qwen3-ASR accepts these 30 case-insensitive language codes and canonical names:

| Codes | Canonical names |
|---|---|
| `ar`, `yue`, `zh`, `cs`, `da`, `nl`, `en`, `fil`, `fi`, `fr` | Arabic, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French |
| `de`, `el`, `hi`, `hu`, `id`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `mk`, `ms` | German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Malay |
| `fa`, `pl`, `pt`, `ro`, `ru`, `es`, `sv`, `th`, `tr`, `vi` | Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese |

The legacy `cn` and regional `zh-*` spellings map to Chinese. Unsupported hints
return HTTP 400. The model recognizes additional Chinese dialects, but they are
not separate forced hints; use `Chinese` or `zh`.

### Long audio

Non-streaming uploads are split into engine requests and reassembled in order.
These model-owned defaults are declared by `Qwen3ASRPipelineConfig`:

| Setting | Value | Behavior |
|---|---:|---|
| `max_audio_clip_s` | 60 | Engine chunk length |
| `max_native_clip_s` | 1,200 | Native and streaming request limit |
| `max_total_audio_s` | 3,600 | Whole non-streaming upload limit |
| `max_concurrent_chunks` | 8 | Per-upload engine concurrency |
| `min_tail_s` | 0.5 | Minimum final chunk length |

`verbose_json` returns one segment per chunk with chunk-level start and end
times, not word timestamps. Formats without a readable duration fall back to
the non-chunked path.

### Streaming

Set `stream=true` to receive incremental transcript deltas over SSE:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F model=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B \
  -F file=@tests/data/query_to_cars.wav \
  -F language=en \
  -F response_format=json \
  -F stream=true
```

Qwen3-ASR batches deltas for up to 50 ms by default. EOS and other terminal
conditions flush buffered text before the final transcript event. Streaming
does not use long-audio chunking, so uploads above 1,200 seconds return HTTP
400. Use non-streaming mode for longer files. See
[Streaming](../user_guide/advanced_features/streaming.md) for the shared event
and terminal-sentinel contract.

## Model-specific configuration

The default `auto` dtype follows the BF16 checkpoint configuration. Pass
`--stages.asr.factory-args.dtype float16` only when you intentionally need FP16.

Async decode is enabled at every batch size. `--decode-mode sync` disables it;
`--async-lookahead-min-batch-size` changes the crossover. Request building uses
eight workers and a pending-build depth of 32. When work exceeds the worker
pool, builds finish asynchronously before scheduler admission; cache hits still
skip mel extraction. The shared prefill-admission gate targets 16 ready
requests with a 40 ms maximum wait, releasing earlier when build work drains
and decode is idle.

The default running-request limit is 64. On memory-constrained hardware, lower
it explicitly; the validated RTX 4090 profile uses 16.

`prompt` is accepted for OpenAI compatibility but Qwen3-ASR ignores it. Audio
is resampled to 16 kHz before transcription.

## Known limitations

- The endpoint accepts one uploaded file per request.
- `/v1/audio/translations` is unsupported.
- Streaming is limited to 1,200 seconds and does not use long-audio chunking.
- Timestamps are chunk-level; the model does not emit word timestamps.
- `prompt` does not affect transcription.

## Benchmark

Use the canonical Seed-TTS ASR benchmark. It records revisions, fingerprints,
sample counts, latency, RTF, throughput, and available process metrics in its
result artifact.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_asr_seedtts \
  --port 8000 \
  --dataset-revision 27f4c1adee83b5b29b7c4b375f6b976324bda308 \
  --model-revision 7278e1e70fe206f11671096ffdd38061171dd6e5 \
  --concurrencies 1,2,4,8,16,32,64 \
  --repeats 3 \
  --warmup
```

The recurring ASR CI gate uses this benchmark entry point. See the
[Qwen3-ASR concurrency profile](../developer_reference/qwen3_asr_concurrency_profile.md)
for the measured tuning study and bottleneck decomposition, and follow the
[benchmark methodology](../benchmarks/methodology.md) when publishing results.
