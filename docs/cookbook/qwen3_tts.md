# Qwen3-TTS

[Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base) is a
discrete multi-codebook text-to-speech family with voice cloning, 10-language
generation, and 24 kHz audio output.

## At a glance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Task | TTS |
| Checkpoints | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-{0.6B,1.7B}-Base`, plus CustomVoice and VoiceDesign variants |
| Endpoint | `/v1/audio/speech` |
| Pipeline | preprocessing → TTS engine → vocoder |
| Input | Text; Base checkpoints also require reference audio |
| Output | 24 kHz audio |
| Streaming | Base checkpoints only |
| Validated hardware | 1× H100 for the 1.7B Base CI configuration |
| Support status | CI tested for 1.7B Base |

`12Hz` is the codec frame rate, not the playback sample rate.

## Install

Install SGLang-Omni by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md).
Qwen3-TTS uses the upstream `qwen-tts` package and the system `sox` binary:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y sox
uv pip install --no-deps sox einops
uv pip install --no-deps qwen-tts==0.1.1
```

Keep `--no-deps` on both commands. Resolving `qwen-tts` would replace the
project's Transformers 5.12 / SGLang 0.5.16 stack with Transformers 4.57.3;
resolving `sox` can upgrade NumPy beyond the `numba==0.65.1` ceiling. Do not add
`onnxruntime`, which is already a project dependency and can trigger the same
NumPy conflict.

SGLang-Omni applies the required Transformers compatibility shim from
`sglang_omni/models/qwen3_tts/compat.py`. If an upstream API change produces a
`TypeError`, report it instead of installing `qwen-tts`'s Transformers pin.

## Deploy

### Recommended configuration

Serve the CI-tested 1.7B Base checkpoint with its checked-in configuration:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_tts_1_7b.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

First startup can take several minutes while the TTS engine captures CUDA
Graphs.

### Other validated configurations

The 0.6B Base checkpoint uses the same pipeline and request format:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_tts_0_6b.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

CustomVoice and VoiceDesign use their own checked-in configs. See
[TTS model usage](../basic_usage/tts.md) for those launch commands and their
text-only request fields.

## Send a request

Base checkpoints clone a voice from `references[0]`. Include the reference
transcript to use in-context-learning mode, which gives better speaker
similarity than speaker-embedding-only mode.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base",
    "voice": "default",
    "input": "SGLang-Omni is a great project!",
    "references": [{
      "audio_path": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
      "text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his."
    }]
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

`ref_audio` and `ref_text` are shorthand for the first reference object's
`audio_path` and `text` fields.

## Model capabilities

### Checkpoint modes

| Mode | Conditioning | Streaming |
|---|---|---|
| Base | Reference audio; transcript recommended | Yes |
| CustomVoice | Checkpoint speaker selected by `voice` | No |
| VoiceDesign | Text plus non-empty `instructions` | No |

### Language hints

`language` defaults to `auto`. You can explicitly select Chinese, English,
Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, or Italian.
Use an explicit hint for short or code-switched input when automatic detection
is unreliable.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` and `"response_format": "pcm"` to receive incremental
16-bit mono PCM. Base checkpoints stream through both the HTTP speech endpoint
and `/v1/audio/speech/stream` WebSocket sessions with `stream_audio=true`.

When `initial_codec_chunk_frames` is omitted, Base checkpoints use 8 frames for
the first vocoder chunk. A smaller value lowers time to first audio but can
increase playback underruns. An explicit `0` uses the steady-state stride from
the first chunk. Utterances shorter than the initial threshold arrive in the
final flush.

### Deterministic inference

Both Base sizes support opt-in deterministic inference:

```yaml
enable_deterministic_inference: true
```

With the same prompt, reference, and seed, this mode produces byte-identical
PCM across runtime batch sizes. It reduces throughput by serializing reference
preprocessing and vocoder decoding and by disabling Talker compilation and the
initial vocoder CUDA Graph, so it is disabled by default.

## Model-specific configuration

Qwen3-TTS defaults to 16 running requests, a waiting-queue depth of 16, four
request-build workers, and a pending-build depth of 16. Every request enters the
waiting queue first, so `--max-queued-requests` must remain at least 1. Requests
beyond the running and queued capacity receive HTTP 503; raising
`--max-running-requests` does not raise the waiting bound automatically.

Non-streaming responses set `X-Finish-Reason` to `stop` after codec EOS or
`length` at `max_new_tokens`. A `length` response is decodable but may contain
an incomplete utterance.

For the complete shared speech request schema, see
[TTS model usage](../basic_usage/tts.md).

## Known limitations

- Base checkpoints need a reference clip for natural output; without one,
  speech is typically robotic.
- Omitting the reference transcript uses speaker-embedding-only mode and
  usually reduces cloning quality.
- `language: auto` can misdetect short or code-switched inputs.
- The 0.6B Base checkpoint has shown rare repetition loops up to
  `max_new_tokens`. Lower that limit or raise `repetition_penalty` when this
  occurs; the 1.7B checkpoint is less prone.

## Benchmark

The canonical Seed-TTS benchmark exercises correctness, latency, throughput,
streaming, and overload behavior:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_tts_seedtts \
  --generate-only \
  --use-existing-server \
  --stream \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --port 8000
```

Use benchmark artifacts for current performance numbers instead of treating a
cookbook snapshot as a release guarantee.
