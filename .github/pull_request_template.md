## CI

CI runs on self-hosted GPU runners and requires a maintainer to add the
`run-ci` label. Once labeled, every subsequent push re-triggers CI as
long as the label remains. Use `/tag-and-rerun-ci higgs` or
`/tag-and-rerun-ci moss` to select a TTS CI model, and
`/tag-and-rerun-ci fun-asr`, `/tag-and-rerun-ci qwen3-asr` or
`/tag-and-rerun-ci whisper-asr` to select an ASR CI model. One selector from each family can be combined, for example
`/tag-and-rerun-ci moss fun-asr`. Draft PRs are skipped even if labeled.
