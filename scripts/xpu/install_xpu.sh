# Usage:
#   scripts/xpu/install_xpu.sh                    # lean core, editable
#   scripts/xpu/install_xpu.sh --extras eval      # core + eval/tests

#
# Never deletes your pyproject.toml: it is backed up and restored on exit.

# — the package then isn't importable outside the repo and no sgl-omni console
